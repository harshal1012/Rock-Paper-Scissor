# About

This was the project that I made while learning JavaScript which is created by our Mentor.

## Overview
This project is a simple implementation of the classic Rock Paper Scissors game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game allows a user to play against the computer, which randomly selects its move.

## Features
- Interactive UI for player input
- Random move selection for the computer
- Real-time result display
- Responsive design for mobile and desktop
